<h3>Introduction to CPU and GPU</h3>

CPU (central processing unit) is a generalized processor that is designed to carry out a wide variety of tasks.A CPU (central processing unit) and a GPU (graphics processing unit) work together to boost data throughput and the number of simultaneous calculations
within an application.

GPU (graphics processing unit) is a specialized processing unit with enhanced mathematical computation capability, ideal for computer graphics and machine-learning tasks.
GPUs were created to create visuals for computer graphics and 
video gaming consoles, but from the early 2010s, they have also been used to speed up calculations involving large amounts of data.
For example,at any given time, a graphically intense video game may have hundreds or thousands of polygons on the screen, each having its own movement, color, lighting, 
and other characteristics. That kind of workload is too much for a CPU to handle. Graphic processing units (GPUs) are used to solve this problem.

<h3>NVIDIA VS AMD </h3>

NVIDIA and AMD rae two of the most popular companies who manufacture GPUs. In deep learning, we mostly used the NVIDIA GPUs.Over the years,
Nvidia has been putting hardware-level optimizations to better support AI-related tasks. Besides, their CUDA software development kit (SDK) 
supports all major machine learning frameworks. Combined with a large, helpful community and libraries, Nvidia is the perfect suit for most ML enthusiasts.
