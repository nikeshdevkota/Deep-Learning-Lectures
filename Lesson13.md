<h3>Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning</h3>

The requirement for labelled training data is the key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Unsupervised machine learning works with unlabeled or raw data, whereas supervised machine learning uses labelled input and output training data. The model learns the relationship between the labeled input and output data in supervised machine learning.

<h3>Generative Models</h3>

In machine learning, generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task that entails automatically detecting and learning regularities or patterns in input data so that the model may be used to produce or output new examples that could have been drawn from the original dataset.
Let's say we have a dataset with photographs of horses. We might want to create a model that can create a fresh image of a horse that has never existed but seems real since the model has learned the general laws that control a horse's appearance. This is the type of problem that generative modeling can tackle.

<h3>Generative Adversarial Network </h3>

In June 2014, Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues created the generative adversarial network (GAN), a class of machine learning frameworks. A GAN trained on images, for example, can create new photographs that appear to human observers to be at least superficially authentic, with many realistic traits.
The GAN model architecture is made up of two sub-models: a generator model for creating new instances/examples and a discriminator model for determining whether the generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.

During training, the generator improves its ability to create realistic images, while the discriminator improves its ability to discern them apart. When the discriminator can no longer discern between actual and bogus images, the process approaches equilibrium.
