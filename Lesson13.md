<h3>Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning</h3>

The requirement for labelled training data is the key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Unsupervised machine learning works with unlabeled or raw data, whereas supervised machine learning uses labelled input and output training data. The model learns the relationship between the labeled input and output data in supervised machine learning.
