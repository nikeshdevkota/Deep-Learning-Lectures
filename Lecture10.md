<h3>Types of RNN</h3>

* One to Many
    *  A single input can produce multiple outputs.
    *  Example: Image Captioning
    
* Many to One
  *   Multiple outputs can produce a single output.
  *   Example: Sentiment Classification 
 
* Many to Many
  * Multiple inputs produce multiple outputs
  * Example: Machine Translation
