<h3>AlexNet</h3>
AlexNet is considered one of the most influential papers published in computer vision, having spurred many more papers published employing CNNs and GPUs to accelerate 
deep learning. As of 2021, the AlexNet paper has been cited over 80,000 times according to Google Scholar.

AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,designed by Alex Krizhevsky in collaboration with Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton, who 
was Krizhevsky's Ph.D. advisor.

AlexNet competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012.The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%,
more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up. 

AlexNet contained five convolutional layers, 3 Max-Pool layers, 2 Normalizing layers and 3 fully connected layers.
